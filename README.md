- 👋 Hi, I’m @kingsley-59. You can call me Kivel for short.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer programing and web development especially backend development.
- 🌱 Actually, I learn everyday. So far I have knowledge of PHP and Python with a sprinkle of Javascript for clientside.
- 💞️ I love to create anything that would generally make life easier. Most times it's not ablout the money, I'm more interested in the value.
- 📫 You can reach me on twitter @KingsleyAkahibe and on LinkedIn with the same name - Kingsley Akahibe.
